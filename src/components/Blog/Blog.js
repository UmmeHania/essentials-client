                                JavaScript is a simple programming language that runs in any browser JavaScript Engine. Whereas Node JS is an interpreter or running environment for a JavaScript programming language that holds many excesses, it requires libraries that can easily be accessed from JavaScript programming for better use.
                                JavaScript is normally used for any client-side activity for one web application. An activity can be addressing business validation or dynamic page display in some schedule time interval or basic Ajax call kind of task. Those are used for a maximum time for any web application. Whereas Node JS mainly used for accessing or running any operating system for non-blocking operation. An operation like creating or executing a shell script, or getting some specific hardware-related information on one call or installed certificate details in the system or a lot of define task is non-blocking on an operating system.
                                JavaScript running in any engine like Spider monkey (FireFox), JavaScript Core (Safari), V8 (Google Chrome). So JavaScript programming is very easy to write, and put any running environment means proper browser. Whereas Node JS only support the V8 engine, which googles chrome specific. But whether it supports the V8 engine, written JavaScript code can able to run in any environment. So there has no browser-specific constraint on it.

                                MongoDB is the Document Oriented Database. MongoDB stores a lot of data in JSON format. MongoDB's performance is much faster than any RDBMS. MongoDB is designed to work with Large Scale Data. MongoDB can work on multiple servers. MongoDB can handle a large number of access requests easily. There are 2 design patterns in programming. One is asynchronous programming and the other is synchronous programming. Node JS by default follows the Asynchronous pattern. That is, it does not wait for a task to be completed. In the meantime, NodeJS started another job. That's why we use nodeJS.

                                SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores. SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.

                                JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.
                                Typically, a private key, or secret, is used by the issuer to sign the JWT. The receiver of the JWT will verify the signature to ensure that the token hasn't been altered after it was signed by the issuer. It is difficult for unauthenticated sources to guess the signing key and attempt to change the claims within the JWT.
